# I'm John Liuüëã Nice to meet you!

### About me

Frontend developer from Taiwan.
<br>
I graduated from the Department of Food Science at National Taiwan Ocean University. I have a passion for experiments and problem-solving, and I good at logical thinking and teamwork.
<br><br>
With the growth of technology trends in recent years, I aspire to learn about information technology, especially focusing on web development. I participated in a professional training course by the Institute for Information Industry, totaling 550 hours, where I used react.js and next.js for group project development. I have the capability to independently produce web pages and can balance aesthetics and functionality visually. In managing backend databases, I use mySQL and node.js, familiar with database relationships and integrating information such as personal information, records, and reviews through API writing. For collaborative projects, I use GitHub to manage project progress, familiar with its operations and capable of resolving file merge conflicts.

### Experience

After graduation, I joined SGS where I worked for six years as a chemist, requiring proficiency in analytical instrumentation techniques and familiarity with chemical compound properties. My responsibilities included routine sample analysis, optimizing experimental methods, instrument maintenance and troubleshooting and developing customized experiments to satisfy client demands.
